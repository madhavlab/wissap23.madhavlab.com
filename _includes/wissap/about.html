                {{ site.inline-logo }} 2023 is an annual winter school on audio and speech processing, started in 2006.
                It provides a forum for researchers to interact with and learn from experts in areas at the forefront of 
                speech and audio signal processing. The past 15 WiSSAPs have covered different aspects of speech and audio 
                processing, such as <span class="emph">audio perception, recognition, coding, enhancement, synthesis, 
                specialization, production, and hearing aids. </span>
            </p>

                {{ site.inline-logo }} goes musical this year with the theme as <span class="emph">Music Information Retrieval: AI for Music</span>. The event 
                will aim to feature talks, tutorials, and posters on a diverse range of topics such as musical genre classification, new interfaces for musical 
                expression, music robotics, computational ethnomusicology, and computer-assisted music instrument tutoring. By leveraging this multidisciplinary 
                approach, the school aims to enhance the computational understanding of music and enable more effective human music interaction.
                This school is the next edtion of <a href="https://wissap.github.io/2020/" style="color: #000;"><span class="logo"><span class="main-name">WiSSAP<span class="superscript" style="color: 0dcbcf !important;"></span></span> <span class="sub-name">2020</span></span></a>.

## Frequently Asked Questions

We will fill this section with questions we receive and our answers.

Q: I could not register/pay by the due date because of [XYZ] reason. Can I get an exception and register/pay after the specified deadline.<br/>
**A: The deadlines are strict and hence we cannot support any extension to the same. We regret for the inconvinience.**

Q: Can I get a refund of the registration fee if I'm not able to attend the school?<br/>
**A: Yes, refunds of the registration fee (minus 18% GST) are possible and will be considered if a justifiable reason is provided (e.g., health issues or unexpected personal circumstances). Refund requests must be submitted no later than 15th November, otherwise, due to the organization costs already incurred (catering and venue services), we will not be able to provide a refund.**

<!-- <span style="color: #FF5356;">Registration is now closed. We thank all the applicants for their interest in the school. The results of the application process will be announced on 28th April 2023.</span> -->

The 16th Winter School on Audio and Speech Processing 2023 (WISSAP '23) welcomes contributions in all the areas related to Audio Processing, MIR and its applications, including music computational analysis, processing, generation, algorithms, and their evaluation. 
Building upon the success of previous WiSSAPs and audio/music conferences such as ISMIR, we aim to provide a dynamic platform for researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts to explore the latest advancements in AI applied to audio processing and Music Information Retrieval.
WiSSAP 23 will aim at fostering collaboration between researchers, developers, educators, librarians, students, and professionals from the disciplines involved in MIR, such as musicology, cognitive science, library and information science, computer science, electrical engineering, and many others, while also promoting discussion and exchange of ideas among the attendees, with particular attention to new topics emerging problems, inclusion and diversity.

## Technical Scope

We invite submissions of ongoing studies and published works, on topics including but not limited to:

- MIR fundamentals and methodology: music signal processing; symbolic music processing; metadata, tags, linked data, and semantic web; lyrics and other textual data; web mining, and natural language processing; multimodality.
- Knowledge-driven approaches to MIR: representations of music; computational music theory and musicology; cognitive MIR; machine learning/artificial intelligence for music; computational ethnomusicology.
- Musical features and properties: melody and motives; harmony, chords and tonality; rhythm, beat, tempo; structure, segmentation, and form; representations of music; timbre, instrumentation, and singing voice; musical style and genre; musical affect, emotion and mood; expression and performative aspects of music.
- MIR tasks: sound source separation; music transcription and annotation; music generation; optical music recognition; alignment, synchronization, and score following; music summarization; music synthesis and transformation; fingerprinting; automatic classification; indexing and querying; pattern matching and detection; similarity metrics.
- Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility: evaluation methodology; evaluation metrics; novel datasets and use cases; annotation protocols; reproducibility.
- Philosophical and ethical discussions: philosophical and methodological foundations; legal and societal aspects of MIR; ethical issues related to designing and implementing MIR tools and technologies.
- Human-centered MIR: user behavior analysis and mining, user modeling; human-computer interaction; music interfaces and services; personalization; user-centered evaluation.
- Computational musicology: mathematical music theory; systematic musicology; digital musicology.
- Applications: digital libraries and archives; music retrieval systems; music recommendation and playlist generation; music and health, well-being and therapy; music training and education; music composition, performance, and production; music videos, multimodal music systems; gaming, augmented/virtual reality; music heritage and sustainability; business and marketing.

## Submission

Authors need to submit a 2- page extended abstract to showcase their work. The submission can be either an ongoing research project or an already published work. It will be reviewed by the technical program committe and a decision will be made on the acceptance of the submission. The type of presentation for the accepted abstracts, i.e. oral or poster shall be decided thereafter. 

More details on the formatting of the submission and where to submit can be found in this section soon.

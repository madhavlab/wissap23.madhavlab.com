The 16th Winter School on Audio and Speech Processing 2023 is pleased to announce two challenges for the WiSSAP Cup 2023. More information about each challenge can be found by visiting the challenge page from the links below. The top-3 ranked teams of each challenged will be invited to join the WiSSAP 2023 program in person from 18th â€“ 21st December and compete in a 1-day hackathon. The winners of both challenges shall be felicitated at the closing ceremony of the school.

## Challenges

### 1. [Music Search: Query by Example]()

Finding perceptually similar audio in a massive audio corpus is computationally and memory expensive. 
Audio fingerprinting is a technique that derives a content-based audio summary and links it with similar audio fragments in the database. It allows for an efficient and quick search against other audio fragments.
The task is to develop method to search a given audio query in a large audio database. The challenge in this task is to efficiently find the best match corresponding to highly distorted query recordings.

### 2. [Music Search: Query by Humming]()
Query-by-humming is a Music Information Retrieval task that enables users to search for songs by humming a tune. This task is challenging due to several factors, including the variability of input signals from a person humming or singing, differences in tempo between recordings and queries, and background noise in the pieces being matched.
The user hums a query which is searched over a database of songs. A ranking is performed over the set of matches detected in the search database to determine the song-id of query.

- The **end** of the **development phase** and **release of test set** will be on October 10th.
- Every team is expected to record their **final results** (test set inference, etc.) and submit them along with a **1-page manuscript** outlining the method developed.
- There are **restrictions** on the scale/size of the method/model, as mentioned in specific task guidelines.
- Submissions adhering to all competition policies shall be **ranked** based on a task-specific metric, and the **top 3 teams** shall be **invited** for a **live (in-person) one-day hackathon** in the winter-school program.

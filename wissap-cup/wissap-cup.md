The 16th Winter School on Audio and Speech Processing 2023 is pleased to announce two challenges for the WiSSAP Cup 2023. More information about each challenge can be found by visiting the challenge page from the links below. The top-3 ranked teams of each challenged will be invited to join the WiSSAP 2023 program in person from 18th â€“ 21st December and compete in a 1-day hackathon. The winners of both challenges shall be felicitated at the closing ceremony of the school.

## Challenges

### 1. <a href="/wissap-cup" target="_blank">Music Search: Query by Example</a>

Finding the same or similar audio in a massive audio corpus is computationally and memory expensive. 
Audio fingerprinting is a technique to index audio datasets for efficient retrieval. Retrieval entails matching the database entries with a given query audio. 
 <!-- that derives a content-based audio summary and links it with similar audio fragments in the database. It allows for an efficient and quick search against other audio fragments. -->
The task in this challenge is to develop method to index a large audio database and search a given audio query efficiently. The query could be a noisy and distorted segment from one of the audios in the database.

### 2. <a href="/wissap-cup" target="_blank">Music Search: Query by Humming</a>
Query-by-humming means to search for a song by humming its tune. 
A general approach is to extract pitch information from each audio in the database and match it efficiently with the pitch information extracted from the query.
This task is challenging due to several factors, including the variability of input signals from a person humming or singing, differences in tempo between recordings and queries, and background instruments/noise in the pieces being matched.
The algorithms are evaluated using measures such as hit rate.

## Guidelines

- Registration of teams for either/both of the two challenges **starts** on August 12.
- Each team must have **no more** than 2 participants.
- The competitions will take place on **Kaggle**. Kindly ensure to sign up on Kaggle before registration. 
- After the **release** of the **development dataset** and/or **baseline** on August 18, the teams can start working on the problem. Participants are **still allowed** to register their teams until September 25.
- The **end** of the **development phase** and **release of test set** will be on October 25th.
- Every team is expected to record their **final results** (test set inference, etc.) and submit them along with a **1-page manuscript** outlining the method developed.
- There are **restrictions** on the scale/size of the method/model, as mentioned in specific task guidelines.
- Submissions adhering to all competition policies shall be **ranked** based on a task-specific metric, and the **top 3 teams** shall be **invited** for a **live (in-person) one-day hackathon** in the winter-school program.
